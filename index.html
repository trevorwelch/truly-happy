              <p class='text-white'>I wrote these songs at a time when many of the narratives I had believed about myself were thrown into question. I became transfixed by the idea of self and the inconsistency of self and reached for imagery to express how I could be many things all at once. In meditating on familiar landscapes and metaphors, I was able to explore my personal dissonance and begin to accept the multitude of selves that I am. - Levi</p>

              <p class='text-white'> 

Heraclitus says: “no one can step in the same river twice.” Truly Happy says: “I am the water / Always changing / I am the water / Always the same.” The constancy of change structures every relationship, every person, every song. Is a river still a river after it’s gone dry? Is the self true and essential or does it change according to its relations? Some Rivers Go Forever embraces paradox without simplifying or solving it. These songs explore the tension between change and continuity in both form and content; at once complex and streamlined, intimate and abstract, these songs help us learn when to come together, when to split apart, and how to forge a path between these disparate moments. -Kristin George Bagdanov</p>

              <p>I was thinking about the inconsistency of the self while writing Some Rivers Go Forever. I had always considered myself a stable person. I had a set identity. I had a narrative for my life. I knew who I was. The events of the past year have caused me to question that identity. My past felt like it was being rewritten. My present was falling apart. I felt a dissonance in myself. Writing these songs was an attempt to reconcile the multitude of selves that I am. - Levi </p>

              <p class=''>This album is the first release coming out on `xnlvg` aka eeeii aka excellent living. I've dreamed of doing a cassette label for some time now, and now's the time! Levi and I recorded this album over a week in Dripping Springs, TX. It felt like some of the purest music I've ever gotten to be a part of, and the decisions we made to sculpt the songs into what they became were all natural and reflexive. I love this album and it reflects a lot of the values that I hope to portray with Excellent Living recs into the future. ~Trevor </p>
